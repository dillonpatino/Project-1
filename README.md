OUR EXPERIENCE

To come up with this idea, we broke down mutual interests and decided on a Hiking Trails app. However it quickly became difficult for us to find API's that would provide location of user to provide a trail nearby.
We brainstormed and found an alternative to provide information on Utah's beautiful National Parks! 
To get started on this project, we first divided it up by styling, and individually working on calling the API’s and the individual functions. Then, as we needed to change the styling or feature, one of us would add it. And if there was an issue we would take turns troubleshooting it to improve on the existing code.
One of the challenges was trying to get the two API’s to communicate with each other. Also, trying to call the function correctly. 
Getting the functions to work and calling the API’s.
